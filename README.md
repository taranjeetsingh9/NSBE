# Thrive - Pain Management Application

## Overview
Thrive is a pain management application aimed at helping individuals better manage and alleviate their chronic pain. As a full-stack developer on the project, I provided guidance in UI/UX design and development. Despite the tight deadline of just 3 days, I eagerly embraced the challenge and made significant contributions to the project's success.

## Key ContributionsI helped design the user interface to make it easy to use and understand.
I built the entire application, working on both the parts you see (the frontend) and the parts you don't (the backend).
I learned how to work on the backend (the part that handles the data and logic behind the scenes) and connected it to the frontend.
I used tools like Express.js and EJS to make the website work smoothly and show information dynamically.
Even though it was challenging to learn new things, I managed to make the backend work well with the frontend.
Our hard work paid off! We won the MLH Best Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Hack award for making sure everyone feels welcome and included in our solution.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
