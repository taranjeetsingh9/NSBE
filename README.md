# Thrive - Pain Management Application

## Overview
Thrive is a pain management application aimed at helping individuals better manage and alleviate their chronic pain. As a full-stack developer on the project, I provided guidance in UI/UX design and development. Despite the tight deadline of just 3 days, I eagerly embraced the challenge and made significant contributions to the project's success.

## Key Contributions
I played a key role in designing the user interface for our application, ensuring it was intuitive and easy to navigate. Additionally, I took charge of developing the entire application, handling both the frontend and backend aspects. Learning backend development was a challenge, but I successfully connected it to the frontend using tools like Express.js and EJS, allowing the website to function smoothly and display information dynamically. Despite the learning curve, I managed to seamlessly integrate the backend with the frontend. Our efforts were recognized when we won the MLH Best Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Hack award, reflecting our commitment to creating a welcoming and inclusive solution.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
